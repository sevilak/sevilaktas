            <p>Hi, I'm Sevil, a web developer with a unique background. Before transitioning into web development, I
                spent 10 years working as a ticketing agent at the airport, where I created and managed ticketsâ€”a
                process surprisingly similar to coding in its need for precision and problem-solving. Now, I use my
                skills to build modern and efficient websites.

                When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time at home with my two cats, and I value the flexibility of
                remote work. Take a look at my projects, and you'll see my passion for creating clean, user-friendly
                solutions. Feel free to reach out, and together we can bring your ideas to life!</p>
